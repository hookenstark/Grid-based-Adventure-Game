A Walk-To algorithm, such as might be used to allow a monster in a grid-based computer game to walk to a target  position where the player is. In such a game, a 2D area is called a level. The program loads a level, including the monster's starting position, from a text file. Then, the program displays the  level, including the monsterâ€™s starting and goal positions, and displays a list of the moves the  monster makes to reach the target. The picture of the level is also printed once for each move.  Each move is one of: north (up), east (right), south (down), and west (left).
